                <p>There are <strong>three types</strong> of loops: for loop, while loop, and do while loop. </p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <strong>for loop:</strong>for ( init; condition; increment ) { statement(s); } <br />
                    The init would be the starting condition. It is the first thing to be executed and only one time.<br />
                    The next would be the condition. If the condition is true, the for loop continues unless it is false.<br />
                    Lastly, the increment can either increase or decrease. It can increase or decrease depending on how you want it to increase/decrease.
                    In c++, the ++ is increasing by one and the -- decrements by one.
                </p>
                
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <strong>while loop:</strong> while(condition){}<br />
                    First, it will check if the condition is true. If the condition is true, then it will go inside the while looop.
                </p>
                    <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <strong>do while:</strong> do{statement(s);}while(condition);<br />
                    The only difference with this loop is it runs at least once. It does the statement first and then it checks the condition if it is true or not.
                </p>
